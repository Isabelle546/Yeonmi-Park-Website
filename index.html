            <h1>Yeonmi's Life</h1>
            <p>Yeonmi Park is a human rights activist from North Korea.  Now she educates people on life in North Korea and how we can help. Yeonmi was born in North Korea on the 4th of October 1993 with two parents and an older sister. Her dad was Keum Sook Byeon, her mum was Park Jin Sik, and her sister is Eun-Mi. Now she has a husband (Ezekiel) and a 5yr old toddler son. When she was young, she escaped at only 13yrs old, and this is her story.</p>
            <p>Life for North Koreans was hard. There was no internet, electricity and running water. Her family lived in a small home, and they had to bathe, drink and wash in the river water. North Korea is known for their dictator and executions. She said that it wasn’t usual to see dead bodies floating around in the river. Guards would shoot and arrest people for petty crimes. Anything ‘offensive’ to their leader and small survival wrong doings. When they were punished, their relatives would have to face the consequences. Yeonmi didn’t even no she was Asian because she was known as a Kim Jon Un (the dictator).  Her parents genuinely loved her, but the word love didn’t exist there. Her mum would tell her ‘Don’t even whisper, because the birds and mice could hear you’. In North Korea you would never know who’s watching, spies and guards could hear your every word, you weren’t your own individual, you had no respect.</p>
            <p>Yeonmi’s life got worse when her dad was arrested for selling goods to people who needed it. He was sentenced for ten years in jail but luckily her family wasn’t badly affected. Her sister had already escaped and gave her a note to tell her a lady who would help her escape. She would bribe the guards and help then. Yeonmi brought her mum with her and another man who would help. She crossed the from lake to China and would finally be free. She said that they couldn’t bribe all the guards because there were ones every hundred metres. She was terrified knowing that at any time she could be shot dead. She said the only reason she was able to escape was because she lived near to the borderline of North Korea. Other North Koreans would have no way to escape so she felt lucky. She believed that when she saw the lights in China, she thought she could find a bowl of rice to feed her family.</p>
            <p>When she arrived her and her mum were sold for less than $300 each to men who would keep them for inappropriate acts. Yeonmi said she felt the want to kill herself being sold to a human trafficker. That’s the day she realised the price of silence. The trafficker told her that if she became his mistress, he would help her find her family. After she was reunited with her family, she was finally told the truth about where she came from.  Kim-Jon-Un was not a god, he can’t read minds they copy the bible, they are DICTATORS. She was taught America was their enemy, that they were monsters and to kill them when they saw them. But when she finally arrived in America, she realised it was all a lie. She saw families smiling and holding their children’s hands. She said that ‘Americans always put the biggest smile on their face when they take photos’. When she arrived, she felt free spirited and felt justice, accepted for who she was. Life from there was also difficult. She began to attend University and study English whiling trying to become a human rights activist.  It was hard to move forward from her cruel life in North Korea, but she did. She began making speeches and educating people on life in North Korea and how we can help.</p>
            <p>In 2018 she gave birth to her first son in America, she said she felt happy that her son was an American citizen, the best thing she could give him was that citizenship. Now she still talks about her life and why we need to help the hopeless people in North Korea.</p>
